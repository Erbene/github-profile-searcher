# Github Profile Searcher

This project consists of github profile searcher. It uses github API to fetch users information and repositories.

## Getting Started

To run this project is pretty simple. Just clone it, install the dependencies with 

```bash
npm install
```
and run it with 

```bash
npm start

## Important

Since this project does not include and API key to the Github API, there is a limited amount of calls you can do without it. I will create a configuration file so you can put yours later if you wish.
